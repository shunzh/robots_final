	          This article presents a novel methodology for a
	          robot to autonomously induce models of its actions
	          and sensors called ASAMI (Autonomous Sensor and
	          Actuator Model Induction).  While previous
	          approaches to model learning rely on an independent
	          source of training data, we show how a robot can
	          induce action and sensor models without any
	          well-calibrated feedback.  Specifically, the only
	          inputs to the ASAMI learning process are the data
	          the robot would naturally have access to: its raw
	          sensations and knowledge of its own action
	          selections.  From the perspective of developmental
	          robotics, our robot's goal is to obtain
	          self-consistent internal models, rather than to
	          perform any externally defined tasks.  Furthermore,
	          the target function of each model-learning process
	          comes from within the system, namely the most
	          current version of another internal system model.
	          Concretely realizing this model-learning methodology
	          presents a number of challenges, and we introduce a
	          broad class of settings in which solutions to these
	          challenges are presented.  ASAMI is fully
	          implemented and tested, and empirical results
	          validate our approach in a robotic testbed domain
	          using a Sony Aibo ERS-7 robot.
